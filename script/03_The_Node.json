This machine is incredibly dumb as it can do only one thing. Calculate as many SHA256 hashes as possible per unit of time. As a result of this heat is dissipated.\nThe miner runs its own node.\nGoing through the pile of unconfirmed transactions(aka the mempool) with a capitalistic desire the miners sort the transactions by who pays more and then pick the ones that are the smallest. At this point, they have a rough idea of what goes into the block.\nIn the block header, there is also other data that is added. A reference to the past block, a magic number that’s not that magic, and some non-specific data. All the data is hashed by the machine.\nAll of this is done at an incredible speed(about 110,000,000,000,000 tries per second per machine) and in a very competitive environment, as everyone wants to get the 6.25 BTC given by the network, in addition to the juicy transaction fees they get to pocket.\nThe winner is the first one to find a block that has the hash smaller than the current mining difficulty target.\"\n\n <br> — Alex Waltz <br><br>\n\n<a href=\"https://rawavocado.medium.com/bitcoin-or-how-we-became-gods-d63f7ddad52a\" target=\"_blank\">https://rawavocado.medium.com/bitcoin-or-how-we-became-gods-d63f7ddad52a</a>",
