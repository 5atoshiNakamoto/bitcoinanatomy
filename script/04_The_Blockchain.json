        "vo": "Without proof-of-work, one would always run into the Oracle problem because the physical realm and the infor­ma­tional realm are eternally discon­nected. The markings on your list of sheep aren’t your sheep, the map is not the terri­tory, and whatever was written in yester­day’s newspaper isn’t neces­sarily what happened in the real world. In the same manner, just because you use a real-world clock to write down a timestamp doesn’t mean that this is actually what the time was.\n\nPut bluntly, there simply is no way to trust that data repre­sents reality, except if the reality in question is inherent in the data itself. The brilliant thing about Bitcoin’s diffi­culty-adjusted proof-of-work is that it creates its own reality, along with its own space and time.\n\nProof-of-work provides a direct connec­tion between the digital realm and the physical realm. More profoundly, it is the only connec­tion that can be estab­lished in a trust­less manner. Every­thing else will always rely on external inputs.\n\nThe diffi­culty to mine a new Bitcoin block is adjusted to make sure that the thin thread between Bitcoin’s time and our time remains intact. Like clock­work, the mining diffi­culty readjusts every 2016 ticks. The goal of this readjust­ment is to keep the average time between ticks at ten minutes. It is these ten minutes that maintain a stable connec­tion between the physical and the infor­ma­tional realm. Conse­quently, a sense of human time is required to readjust the ticks of the Bitcoin clock. A purely block-based readjust­ment wouldn’t work since it would be completely discon­nected from our human world, and the whole purpose of the readjust­ment is to stop us ingenious humans from finding blocks too fast (or too slow).\n\nAs Einstein has shown us, time is not a static thing. There is no such thing as a universal time we could rely upon. Time is relative, and simul­taneity is nonex­is­tent. This fact alone makes all timestamps — especially across large distances — inher­ently unreli­able, even without adver­sarial actors. \n<br> — Der Gigi <br><br>\n\n<a href=\"https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/\" target=\"_blank\">https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/</a>",
